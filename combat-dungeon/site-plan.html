			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of this site is to help dungeon masters keep track of there enemies stats, health, attacks, and anything else they would need in combat. The enemies will be pre-loaded so that the user can search up the stats they want. And there will be options for adding custom monster too.

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				This website will be targeted to those who are fans of the table top role playing game dungeons and dragons. Specifically it will be meant for those who are Dungeon Masters and aid them in their combat games.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				The wesite will be dynamic in that it will store the info of the monsters in objects in a list of arrays. That information will then be put in the html using javascript. There will also be a search bar where you can search for what monster you would like. Many different buttons to add monsters to the combat or to start, and finally there will be a way to update the objects by reducing the hp of the monster
